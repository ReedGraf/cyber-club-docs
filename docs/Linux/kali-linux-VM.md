# Getting a Linux Virtual Machine!

This is a tutorial on how to get a linux virtual machine.

Install the kali linux distro [here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images) **make sure to choose installer images**. If you have an apple device choose apple silicon, if you have anything else choose x86_64.

Download Oracle VM [here](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html) again choose your download option off of what device you have

Next start [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX75Z-4MEoM&t=47s) at 11:55, and follow his steps.

When you get the virtual machine booted up, make sure to run both of these command prompts in the terminal (you can just copy past if you would like)

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

and

```bash
sudo reboot
```

**When it asks for a password, put in your account password**
