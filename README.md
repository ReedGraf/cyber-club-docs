## Local Development

This site runs using [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Once you have nodejs and npm installed, navigate to the directory with this code and run 

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
